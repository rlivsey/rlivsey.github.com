        <p>Meeting Collaboration Made Easy</p>
        <p>Co-Founder &amp; CTO</p>
        <p>2009 &ndash; Present</p>
      </div>

      <p>MinuteBase was founded in 2009 by Richard Livsey and Fabian Sasson. We had worked together on several web applications meeting with customers, gathering requirements, and documenting those discussions with the traditional mix of email, Office documents and calendars. We realised we needed to move beyond what we called &#8220;dead documents&#8221; &mdash; those destined to be printed out and forgotten.</p>
      <p>We looked around for better ways of collaboration around meetings, but nothing seemed to fit. We wanted there to be one central place for all our meetings, tasks and documents.</p>
      <p>We began to draft ideas about how such an app might look and work. Through 2009 we iterated on the idea, impressing our clients with clean, readable agendas, minutes and actions arriving in their mailboxes ready for sign off or comment. They liked it so much they urged us to start selling it.</p>
      <p>In 2010 we launched a beta product and gained thousands users from business, education and non-profit sectors. Our early adopters gave us a huge amount of feedback and we spent time building on what worked and redesigning what didnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>In June 2011 we released MinuteBase 2.0 and started charging.</p>

        <p>Development Manager, Gibraltar</p>
        <p>March 2009 &ndash; April 2010</p>
      </div>

      <p>Victor Chandler had outsourced the redevelopment of their entire web and mobile presence to a small team in Brazil but the project was failing, coming in at a year overdue and massively over budget.</p>
      <p>I was brought in to recruit and manage a new in-house Rails development team to get the project back on track and also kick-off a number of other high-profile projects.</p>
      <p>We moved the development team from being part of IT and into the Marketing and Sales department, this brought us closer to the customers and teams responsible for the site's content, improving communication and reducing development times.</p>
      <p>Using agile development methodologies such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives after every sprint we continually improved the development process, vastly improving the morale of the development teams and the company.</p>
      <p>Continuous integration and deployment enabled us to reduce the time taken for a feature being requested to it being deployed in production from months to days, whilst improving the quality of the code and reducing bugs.</p>

        <p>September 2006 &ndash; March 2009</p>
      </div>

      <p>CitySafe's pioneering and user-friendly approach to emergency management redefined integrated emergency response.</p>
      <p>We designed, developed, and implemented London's incident response and co-ordination application, and emergency notification systems - in less than 30 months.</p>
      <p>From the company's inception I was responsible for technical development, building and managing the development team and liaising with clients to improve our products.</p>
      <p>Our systems were put to use in a number of high profile events, such as the 7/7 bombings and Haymarket attempted car bombs, and are used daily by London boroughs, the Met Police, City of London Police, Special Branch and across Canary Wharf.</p>

        <p>Developer &amp; Outsourced Development Management</p>
        <p>2003 &ndash; 2005</p>
      </div>

      <p>Developed a market-leading intelligence analysis application, aggregating data from over 500 news sources and analysing it to create global real-time risk-contour maps for use by the insurance industry.</p>
      <p>In less than 18 months this enabled them grow from a 2 to a 40 man company with a global network of intelligence analysts, since the easy-to-use system allowed the team to focus on core competencies, and not the technology.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the project I managed outsourced developers based throughout the globe, from Scotland to Russia.</p>
